Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women globally. There is research to develop better prevention methods, early detection, effective treatments, and to improve survival rates of patients. My research focused on visualizing the data, however the data has 30 features so I opted to use PCA to reduce dimensions and visualize the data.
