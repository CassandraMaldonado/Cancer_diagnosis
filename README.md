# Cancer Diagnosis Using PCA and Feature Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of cancer patient records to explore which features best differentiate malignant from benign tumors. It uses exploratory data analysis, statistical comparisons, and dimensionality reduction (PCA) to gain insights into patterns that support diagnostic predictions.

## Objectives
*1. Feature Distribution Analysis.*

- Visualize and compare distributions of diagnostic features across malignant and benign tumors using histograms and boxplots.

- Use statistical measures to identify the top 3 features with the strongest class separation.

*2. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA.*

- Apply PCA to the high-dimensional data into 2D.

Visualize clusters and interpret patterns between cancer types in reduced dimensions.
